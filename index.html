                        Dragon equipment is a range of tier 60 equipment available to
                        members. With the exception of dragon arrows, dragon darts and
                        dragon javelins, dragon items are made of a hard, dark-red metal
                        called Orikalkum, with the former three being made of dragon talons
                        rather than Orikalkum. The dragonkin are the original creators of
                        Orikalkum armour and weaponry, which is nicknamed by adventurers as
                        dragon equipment.

                <h3 class="pb-2">Dragon Weapons</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">
                    Dragon weapons are some of the most powerful weapons for mid-level
                    players, and cannot be made through the Smithing skill. All dragon
                    weapons require level 60 Attack, Ranged in the case of dragon darts
                    and dragon arrows, or Strength in the case of the dragon warhammer);
                    alongside usually requiring the completion of specific quests to
                    wield. Most also have special attacks. Dragon weapons are very popular
                    with new members with level 60 Attack, as Lost City is very easy to
                    complete and is the only other requirement besides level 60 Attack to
                    wielding the dragon longsword and dragon dagger.
                </p>
                <h3 class="pb-2">Dragon Armour</h3>
                <p class="pb-3">
                    Dragon armour is the most common next step up from rune armour,
                    although granite armour, requiring 50 Defence, is sometimes considered
                    the real step up from rune armour. All dragon armour requires level 60
                    Defence to wear. They are a distinctive dark red in colour, usually
                    with additional details that make them look different from previous
                    armours (like the dragon full helm having spikes) and are generally
                    sold at fairly high prices, or are dropped by high-levelled monsters
                    at a low drop rate. Dragon armour is considered one of the highest
                    sought-after Melee armour in the game for mid-levelled players. It is
                    often debated whether it is more cost-effective to buy dragon armour
                    or Barrows equipment, since Barrows equipment requires repair every 15
                    hours of combat, though Barrows equipment has much higher defence
                    bonuses than dragon armour. The dragon square shield is created by
                    combining a shield left half with a shield right half on an anvil,
                    which requires level 60 Smithing. Note that the Legends' Quest has to
                    be completed to be able to wield or make this shield.
