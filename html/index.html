        <h2>Dragon Equipment</h2>
        <p>Dragon equipment is a range of tier 60 equipment available to members. With the exception of dragon arrows,
            dragon darts and dragon javelins, dragon items are made of a hard, dark-red metal called Orikalkum, with the
            former three being made of dragon talons rather than Orikalkum. The dragonkin are the original creators of
            Orikalkum armour and weaponry, which is nicknamed by adventurers as dragon equipment.

        <h3>Dragon Weapons</h3>
        <p>Dragon weapons are some of the most powerful weapons for mid-level players, and cannot be made through the
            Smithing skill. All dragon weapons require level 60 Attack, Ranged in the case of dragon darts and dragon
            arrows, or Strength in the case of the dragon warhammer); alongside usually requiring the completion of
            specific quests to wield. Most also have special attacks.

            Dragon weapons are very popular with new members with level 60 Attack, as Lost City is very easy to complete
            and is the only other requirement besides level 60 Attack to wielding the dragon longsword and dragon
            dagger.

        <h3>Dragon Armour</h3>
        <p>Dragon armour is the most common next step up from rune armour, although granite armour, requiring 50
            Defence, is sometimes considered the real step up from rune armour. All dragon armour requires level 60
            Defence to wear. They are a distinctive dark red in colour, usually with additional details that make them
            look different from previous armours (like the dragon full helm having spikes) and are generally sold at
            fairly high prices, or are dropped by high-levelled monsters at a low drop rate.

            Dragon armour is considered one of the highest sought-after Melee armour in the game for mid-levelled
            players. It is often debated whether it is more cost-effective to buy dragon armour or Barrows equipment,
            since Barrows equipment requires repair every 15 hours of combat, though Barrows equipment has much higher
            defence bonuses than dragon armour.

            The dragon square shield is created by combining a shield left half with a shield right half on an anvil,
            which requires level 60 Smithing. Note that the Legends' Quest has to be completed to be able to wield or
            make this shield.
