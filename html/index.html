                <p>Dragon equipment is a range of tier 60 equipment available to members. With the exception of dragon
                    arrows,
                    dragon darts and dragon javelins, dragon items are made of a hard, dark-red metal called Orikalkum,
                    with
                    the
                    former three being made of dragon talons rather than Orikalkum. The dragonkin are the original
                    creators
                    of
                    Orikalkum armour and weaponry, which is nicknamed by adventurers as dragon equipment.

            <h3 class="pb-2">Dragon Weapons</h3>
            <p>Dragon weapons are some of the most powerful weapons for mid-level players, and cannot be made through
                the
                Smithing skill. All dragon weapons require level 60 Attack, Ranged in the case of dragon darts and
                dragon
                arrows, or Strength in the case of the dragon warhammer); alongside usually requiring the completion of
                specific quests to wield. Most also have special attacks.

                Dragon weapons are very popular with new members with level 60 Attack, as Lost City is very easy to
                complete
                and is the only other requirement besides level 60 Attack to wielding the dragon longsword and dragon
                dagger.
            </p>

            <h3 class="pb-2">Dragon Armour</h3>
            <p>Dragon armour is the most common next step up from rune armour, although granite armour, requiring 50
                Defence, is sometimes considered the real step up from rune armour. All dragon armour requires level 60
                Defence to wear. They are a distinctive dark red in colour, usually with additional details that make
                them
                look different from previous armours (like the dragon full helm having spikes) and are generally sold at
                fairly high prices, or are dropped by high-levelled monsters at a low drop rate.

                Dragon armour is considered one of the highest sought-after Melee armour in the game for mid-levelled
                players. It is often debated whether it is more cost-effective to buy dragon armour or Barrows
                equipment,
                since Barrows equipment requires repair every 15 hours of combat, though Barrows equipment has much
                higher
                defence bonuses than dragon armour.

                The dragon square shield is created by combining a shield left half with a shield right half on an
                anvil,
                which requires level 60 Smithing. Note that the Legends' Quest has to be completed to be able to wield
                or
                make this shield.
